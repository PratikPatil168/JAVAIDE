<p>Java 7 Update 21 introduced changes to the Java browser plug-in behavior that enable you to make more informed decisions before running the Java applet in the browser. A security prompt asks for confirmation before allowing Java content to run in the browser. For users, developers and system administrators who need <a href="#background">more technical information</a> refer to the links provided at the end of this article.</p>

<p><b>Risk Levels</b><br/>
The messages presented depends upon different risk factors, such as using old versions of Java or running applet code that is not signed from a trusted Certificate Authority.
Apps that present a lower risk display a simple informational message. This includes an option to prevent showing similar messages for apps from the same publisher in the future.</p>

<p>This page describes the prompts to help you understand the risks of running the Java applet.</p>

<h4><a name="revokecheck">Revocation Checking for Java Applications</a></h4>
Starting with Java 7u25, before attempting to launch any Java application, the signing certificate will be validated against the issuing certificate authority, using Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to check that the certificate used to sign the application has not been revoked by the issuing Certificate Authority.<br/><br/>

This feature will protect end user systems from malicious developers who in the past used stolen certificates, or illicitly purchased certificates to sign applications. Before running any web-deployed application with Java 7u25 (and later), there will be an attempt to contact the certificate authority to check revocation status to help guard against stolen or compromised certificates.
<br/><br/>
<b>What to look for</b>:<br/>
The revocation check can return different messages based on the check:
<ul>
<li>Certificate is revoked</li>
<li>Failed to validate certificate</li>
<li>Unable to connect to Certificate Authority</li>
</ul>

<h4>Certificate is revoked. Application will not be executed.</h4>

This dialog displays when running an application with a certificate that has been revoked by the Certificate Authority (CA). This scenario presents the <b>highest level of risk</b>. The application will not be executed as it can be from a malicious source.
<br/><br/>
<img alt="Certificate revoked - The certificate of an application from the listed location is revoked. This application will not be executed" class="ctralign" src="../../../ga/images/en/cert_revoked.jpg%3bfilename_%3dUTF-8%27%27cert_revoked.jpg"/>

<h4>Failed to validate certificate. Application will not be executed.</h4>

This dialog displays when running an application with a certificate that cannot be validated by the Certificate Authority (CA). It appears if you have set the security level to Very High within the Java Control Panel, and the certificate cannot be validated. 
<br/><br/>
<img alt="Certificate validation failed - The certificate for the application from the listed location cannot be validated.

				<span class="bodytext">
			
		
				
		
			
		










<h4>Unable to connect to Certificate  Authority</h4>

This dialog displays when there is a network failure and the Certificate Authority (CA) cannot be reached to validate the certificate. In this case, it is usually safe to run the application because their actions are limited, but may still present a <b>moderate level of risk</b>. We recommend you hit Cancel. if you are not familiar with the publisher of the site you are visiting.
